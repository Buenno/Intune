# Remediations

Here you'll find a collection of detection and remediation scripts. So far I have added the following:
* PowerAutomateDesktop - Removes the application if it's installed.
* TeamsAutoRun - Disabled auto-start of the Teams application. **Please note**: this applies only to the "new" teams, not consumer/classic. Must be run in the user context.
* TeamsConsumer - Remove the application if it's installed.
